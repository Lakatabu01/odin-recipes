    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>We took a couple shortcuts for this recipe by using store-bought marinara and boxed pasta sheets. It saves a ton of time without sacrificing any flavor. We think it's absolutely perfect as-is, but also understand some people are looking to make sauce from scratch.</p>

    <h4>Ingridients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Store-bought red pasta sauce</li>
    <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>Ground beef</li>
    <li>An egg</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Cheese Filling Mix the ricotta and cheeses (per recipe below) with an egg in a bowl, and set aside. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
    <li>Meat Sauce Brown the onion, garlic, and meat in a pot on the stovetop. Add the pasta sauce and tomato paste & simmer a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Layer Together Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with noodles and bake until bubbling</li>
</ol>
